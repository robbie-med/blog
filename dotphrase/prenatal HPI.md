## **FOCUS adult HPI**
This is a __ yo patient with history of (hepatitis C, opiate use disorder, etc) who presents for follow up with the FOCUS clinic.
1. Opiate use disorder, in remission, on MAT with Suboxone.  
- Current dose (desire to go up or down)
- Symptoms (note patient’s rating for each: craving, withdrawal, anxiety, depression, difficulty sleeping)
- Recent relapses reported
- Last UDM and today’s POC UDM
- Review of PMP (when last Rx was filled and any other controlled substances filled)
- Engagement with counseling
2. Psychiatric diagnoses (if relevant).
- Current medications and symptoms.
3. Hepatitis C status.
- Hep C antibody: (reactive or nonreactive and date)
- If reactive antibody, do Hep C PCR: 
- If PCR +, needs CBC/LFTs and abdominal US:
- If evidence of cirrhosis on US, needs US every 6 months, MELD score (Chem7/LFTs/INR), EGD to screen for varices 
-  Assess interest in Hep C treatment:
4.  Other health conditions (hypertension, hypothyroidism, musculoskeletal concerns, etc)
5. Contraception.
6. HCM:
- Last pap:  (and when next is due)
- Immunizations:
- Lipid panel (if > 35), mammogram/colon cancer screening (if > 50)




## Preeclampsia

Patient’s EGA >21 weeks, blood pressure elevation, and laboratory workup consistent with Preeclampsia WITHOUT evidence of Eclampsia or HELLP.  
**Workup** (including but not limited to): CBC, CMP, Mag-Phos, LDH, Uric Acid level, UA  
**Findings**: NO Severe Features (such as visual disturbances, pulmonary edema, AKI, thrombocytopenia <100k, transaminitis 2x normal)  
**Intervention**: IV Labetalol  
**Disposition**: Admit to OBGYN

- Treatment
    - Labetalol:
        - Inpatient: 10mgIV doubled every 20min PRN to total of 300mg OR 1-2mg/min gtt
        - Outpatient: 100mg PO BID
    - Methyldopa
        - 0.25-1g BID
    - If patient seizes preferentially give 4g Mag IV bolus over everything else followed by more Magnesium.
- Disposition Home?
    - For patients with hypertension without severe features or proteinuria that improves in ED without intervention
    - History of hypertension
        - Often recommended not to increase or start new anti-hypertensive Rx outpatient since this could prevent the patient from returning. Better to discuss SRP with patient (including to return to Emergency Department immediately if Systolic BP ≥160 or Diastolic BP ≥110 on any single measurement)
    - NO history of HTN:
        - Return to ED immediately if Systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart

## Post Partum Hemorrhage

The patient appears to be suffering from secondary postpartum hemorrhage.  
Based on History, Exam, and Workup I believe the patient’s presentation is not consistent with life-threatening coagulopathy, trauma, serious bacterial infection, central process.  
**  
Consult**: OBGYN  
**Disposition**: Admit to OBGYN for further clinical monitoring, serial labs, and possible transfusions.

- Definition: “excessive” vaginal bleeding occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks postpartum.
- Causes: Retained POC or sub involution of placental bed
- Workup:
    - TVUS: to assess for retained POC, subinvolutions of placental bed, vascular abnormality (pseudoaneurysm or AVM)
- Treatment
    - Acutely 4Ts
        - **Tone**
            - 1st line:
                - Pitocin 80U in 500cc NS Wide Open (more rapid administration may cause hypotension)
            - 2nd line:
                - Misoprostol (Cytotec) 1000mcg Per Rectum
            - 3rd line:
                - Methergine 0.2mg IM q2hr
                - Bakri balloon
        - **Tissue** (retained placenta): manual removal OR DandC
        - **Trauma**
            - Laceration
                - 2-0 or 3-0 figure of 8’s
            - Uterine Inversion
                - Push it back quick! Stop pitocin until pushed back, then restart
        - **cloTTing**
            - Massive Transfusion
            - TXA 1g —30min—> repeat
        
    - OBGYN Decisions
        - Retained POC –> D&C
        - Subinvolution –> methylergonovine or carbopost –> possibly followed by laparotomy embolization, vessel ligation, or hysterectomy

## Endometritis

The patient appears to be suffering from endometritis.  
Patient’s symptoms not typical for other emergent causes of abdominal pain such as, but not limited to, appendicitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, surgical biliary disease, pancreatitis, SBO, mesenteric ischemia, TOA, ovarian torsion.  
**Workup**: Pelvic Ultrasound (to evaluate for abscess, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis)  
**Consult**: OBGYN  
**Interventions**: Clindamycin and Gentamicin  
**Disposition**: Admit to OBGYN for continued IV ABX, monitoring, lab draws, and potential surgical management

## PROM

The patient appears to have suffered Premature Rupture of Membranes.  
Since she is without contractions, pelvic exam deferred to minimize risk of infection.  
**Workup**: Defer Ultrasound and labs to inpatient team as patient is clinically well  
**Interventions**: IV Ampicillin and Erythromycin  
**Disposition**: Admit to OBGYN Labor and Delivery

- Definitions:
    - <37 weeks = Pre-term PROM
- Treatment
    - >32 weeks consult GYN re ABX
