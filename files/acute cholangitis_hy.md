# If You Remember Nothing Else

> Cholangitis is an ascending biliary infection due to obstruction at the level of the common bile duct. The obstruction can be gallstones, strictures, or malignancy (pancreatobiliary cancers commonly). Get antibiotics started immediately and recognize that unless you achieve source control via relief of obstruction (commonly via ERCP), the patient will not improve.

# Clinical Pearls

- Cholangitis is an ascending biliary infection due to obstruction at the level of the common bile duct
- Those with palliative stenting for malignant obstruction are at increased risk
- Post ERCP complications include pancreatitis and hematogenous seeding of bacteria
- RUQUS > CT for detecting the presence of stones in the gallbladder; for choledocholithiasis will see CBD dilation >7mm but likely not the stone
- Acalculous cholecystitis can be seen in acute illness due to stasis/ischemia - will see GB thickening, pericholecystic fluid, sonographic Murphyâ€™s
